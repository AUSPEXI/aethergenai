# 8D Swarm Safety Kit and Topological Flocking (Concept & Roadmap)

## Purpose and Scope
This document sketches how AethergenPlatform’s 8D manifold control and non‑linear algebraic methods can enable large‑scale, resilient drone swarms (1k–15k+) with evidence‑backed safety. It is an architectural and research plan to be shelved until core models are shipped; it also seeds a future public case‑study/blog.

## Problem Statement
Current shows and industrial swarms can fail catastrophically when command/control or a subset of agents misbehave. We aim to design decentralized, topology‑aware control with strong safety guarantees so that local failures do not cascade.

## 8D State Manifold (agent state)
An agent’s control state lives on an 8‑dimensional manifold M capturing kinematics and mission/safety context. Example coordinates (choose 8 based on use‑case):
- Position: x, y, z
- Velocity: vx, vy, vz
- Health/risk: h (battery/IMU confidence/ESC thermal)
- Link/latency/role: ℓ (QoS tier, comm health, role index)

Alternative dimensions: local density estimate, goal progress, formation slot, altitude band, airspace rule mode.

## Behavioral Fields and Topology
- Topological neighborhood (not purely metric): each drone tracks k≈7 nearest neighbors by graph connectivity, improving resilience in variable density (starling heuristic).
- Potential/field design via non‑linear functions and SDFs:
  - Cohesion/Alignment/Separation terms
  - Goal/formation fields, geofences as hard SDF constraints
  - Density regulation (avoid crowding), turbulence/wind compensation
- Control follows negative gradients on M, combined with hard safety constraints (below).

## Safety Layer (hard constraints)
- Control Barrier Functions (CBFs): enforce h_i(x) ≥ 0 for min‑separation, altitude bands, geofence and no‑fly constraints.
- Real‑Time Assurance (RTA) supervisor: overrides learned/heuristic commands when constraint violation is imminent; degrades to safe mode (hover/rise/land) based on context.
- Resilient consensus (W‑MSR): filters outliers/Byzantine agents from neighbor sets to avoid cascading failures.
- Fault isolation: local graph repairs “holes”; role reassignment maintains connectivity and coverage.

## Communications & Graph Model
- ROS 2/DDS or equivalent pub/sub with bounded message sizes; periodic heartbeat; local broadcast range limits.
- Neighbor graph: dynamic k‑NN in topological sense; timeout and packet‑loss handling; link quality contributes to ℓ.
- Compliance hooks: geofence updates, ATC directives, remote ID integration where applicable.

## Simulation & Training (NVIDIA Omniverse / Isaac Sim)
- Physics: 3D kinematics, wind gusts, GNSS bias/drift, sensor latency; domain randomization across weather and time of day.
- Failure injection: motor loss, GPS dropouts, comm partitions, sensor spikes.
- Policy learning: multi‑agent RL + imitation (murmuration traces/expert), GNN/attention for decentralized policies atop the safety layer.
- Curriculum: scale agents 100 → 1k → 10k with staged constraints and tighter latency budgets.

## Evaluation & Evidence (for procurement and audit)
- Safety: violations per flight‑hour, minimum separation breaches, geofence intrusions (target: zero with RTA), recovery time from k failures.
- Connectivity & resilience: component of the largest connected subgraph over time; mission completion score under partitions.
- Efficiency: energy per mission, trajectory smoothness, task throughput.
- Packaging: signed evidence bundle with metrics, seeds, config, and hashes (ties into platform evidence system).

## Edge Packaging & Deployment
- Export compact policies and safety controllers for Jetson/PC GPUs (INT8/Q4/FP16). Use Aethergen Edge Bundle (GGUF/ONNX/LoRA options) with device profiles.
- Offline policy packs: default CBFs, geofences, RTA thresholds, and logging toggles; checksum/SBOM inclusion.
- On‑device watchdog and flight‑mode selection to ensure fail‑safe degradation.

## Governance, Security, Compliance
- Airspace: configurable geofencing, altitude limits, restricted zones per locale.
- Logging: append‑only offline logs; periodic signed digests.
- Supply chain: SBOM for artifacts, checksums, optional signatures; license controls and adapter watermarking.

## Risks and Mitigations
- Multi‑agent scalability: use topological neighbor limits, sparse comms, and GNN policies for linear scaling.
- Sensor/comms unreliability: RTA dominance with conservative fallbacks; robust estimators.
- Adversarial/Byzantine nodes: W‑MSR filtering; authenticated comms; anomaly detection on behaviors.
- Regulatory variance: policy profiles per jurisdiction; verifiable audit trails.

## Roadmap (shelved until core models ship)
- MVP (R&D):
  - Baseline topological boids + CBF/RTA in Isaac for 1–3k agents; wind and GPS noise; failure injection.
  - Evidence kit v1: violation histograms, resilience curves, signed report.
- Beta:
  - GNN decentralized policy; domain randomization; device‑aware quantization; on‑device watchdog.
  - Policy pack and offline deploy guides; procurement‑grade evidence bundle.
- GA:
  - Expanded airspace compliance features, operator tools, and field telemetry integrations.

## Mathematical Sketch (high‑level)
- CBF constraint: h_j(x) ≥ 0 (e.g., min‑sep − ||p_i − p_n||). Find u minimizing ||u − u_ref|| s.t. ḣ_j(x,u) + α h_j(x) ≥ 0 for all j.
- Topological neighbor set: N_k(i) via robust k‑nearest using connectivity/quality score.
- Reward (RL): w_safety·penalty(violations) + w_cohesion·cohesion + w_goal·goal − w_energy·usage − w_latency·delays.

## Public Case Study (future blog outline)
- Title: “From Starlings to Swarms: 8D Safety for Thousands of Drones”
- Story beats: problem, 8D state, safety layer, simulation campaigns, resilience results, edge deployment, evidence.
- CTA: contact for regulated pilots; downloadable red‑team prompts and eval snippets.
