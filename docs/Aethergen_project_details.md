AethergenAI: What We’re Building and Why
Vision
Build the leading platform for efficient, compliant AI in the post-scaling era by replacing brute-force GPU training with high-fidelity synthetic data, ablation-driven optimisation, and lean training techniques. The result: better models, faster, at a fraction of the cost—and deployable in regulated environments, guided by human insight to balance technological power.
The Problem We Solve

Cost and compute walls: Scaling models with raw GPU spend is hitting diminishing returns.
Data scarcity and compliance: Regulated sectors can’t freely use real data; de-identification is brittle and risky.
Opaque training: Organisations lack evidence for why a model performs and what to change next.
Fragmented tooling: Data generation, evaluation, and governance live in disconnected systems.

Our Approach

Synthetic-first: Train and validate on high-fidelity synthetic data with <3% real data reliance to bootstrap and calibrate.
Evidence-driven: Use ablation testing as a first-class workflow to isolate what truly impacts accuracy, privacy, and cost.
Lean training: Adopt MoE routing and low-precision (FP8/INT8) techniques to maximise efficiency (inspired by industry successes).
Compliance by design: Privacy metrics, proofs (zk), and lineage artefacts built into the workflow—not bolted on later—ensuring ethical oversight.

Product Pillars

Privacy and Integrity

Differential privacy controls (ε), synthetic/real ratio, privacy attack metrics.
ZK proof artefacts for data integrity and pipeline assertions.


Modularity

Schema-driven design; domain adapters (e.g., DICOM, logistics, finance).
Swap-in generators, evaluators, and downstream tasks without platform rewrites.


Evidence and Reproducibility

Ablation recipes as versioned, shareable specs with aggregated “ablation cards”.
Lineage and audit bundle: schema hash, dataset versions, privacy config, proof hashes.


Developer Velocity

Templates (MoE, multi-token prediction, time-series, vision) and a simple recipe runner.
One-click run locally; scale the same recipe to Databricks later.


Interoperability

Local-first MVP; cloud-ready for Databricks jobs, Delta/MLflow tracking, Unity Catalog.



Core Workflows

Schema Design: Define fields, constraints, and privacy settings for any domain.
Upload Seed Data: Minimal, sanitised seed to shape distributions and relationships.
Generate Synthetic Data: Fast local generation pipeline with quality/throughput telemetry.
Benchmarks (Ablations)

Interactive: Toggle modules and run comprehensive benchmarks.
Recipes: Declarative sweeps (model filters, precision, privacy, repeats) → aggregated results.


Privacy Metrics: Membership inference, nearest neighbour, attribute disclosure; adjust ε and synthetic ratio.
Reporting: Quality, cost, risk dashboards, plus a live Model Collapse Risk Dial.
Governance: Exportable artefacts (reports, ablation cards, proofs) for audit and procurement.

Architecture (MVP → Beta)

MVP (Local)

React modules for design, generation, benchmarks, privacy, reporting.
Local ablation runner mapping recipes to the benchmarking pipeline.
ZK proof dev-path (fallback proof + verification hooks).


Beta (Cloud)

Databricks: Recipe → jobs API → MLflow runs → Delta outputs; Unity Catalog for governance.
Dataset lineage and signed evidence bundles surfaced in UI.
Optional cost-aware scheduling and role-based access.



Why We’re Different

Efficiency over scale: MoE + FP8/INT8 + ablation-guided datasets > “more GPUs”.
Compliance-first: Built-in privacy controls, proofs, and provenance for regulated buyers.
Reproducibility and shareability: Recipes turn UI decisions into runnable, auditable specs.
Domain acceleration: Adapters and templates reduce time-to-value for niche, high-ROI use cases.
Prompt-informed synthesis: Integrates prompt-driven synthetic data practices to keep models efficient and contextually rich.

Initial Niches to Prioritise

NHS diagnostics: Imaging and tabular care pathways; privacy-critical, high benefit from synthetic data.
MoD logistics/simulations: Geospatial/time-series; plan/route optimisation and red-teamable scenarios.
Engage early adopters (e.g., NHS data scientists, MoD analysts) via Databricks community to co-design use cases.

KPIs (MVP/Beta)

Model utility: ≥90% task performance vs. real-data baselines on targeted tasks.
Privacy safety: <5% attack success across core metrics at tuned ε.
Cost efficiency: ≥5–10× lower training/inference cost for comparable utility.
Time-to-experiment: <5 minutes to define schema and launch a recipe; <30 minutes to aggregate results.

8D Roadmap (Signposted)

Phase 1: 4D–6D traffic/logistics sim data with ablations validating dimensional relevance.
Phase 2: 8D non-linear systems (flocking, virtual worlds) with agent-based sim backends, governed by ablation evidence, pending testing success.

Governance & Evidence
Every meaningful run yields an evidence pack:

Schema hash, dataset version, ε, synthetic ratio.
Privacy metrics, quality/utility, and cost.
Proof references (where applicable).
Recipe hash, ablation summary, and “ablation card”.

What’s Live Now (Local MVP)

Schema design → upload → generate → benchmarks → privacy → reporting workflow.
Live Model Collapse Risk Dial.
Ablation Recipes (JSON): Run, load, save; export summary JSON/CSV.
Example recipe in docs/ABLATION_RECIPES_EXAMPLE.json.

What’s Next

Thread privacy controls from recipes fully through generation and evaluation.
Preset recipe loader and domain templates.
Optional YAML parser; MLflow/Delta integration when moving to Databricks.

Risks & Mitigations

DP–utility trade-off: Tune ε with ablations; report confidence intervals.
Sim-to-real gap: Periodic calibration with limited real data and drift checks.
Domain shift: Drift monitoring and recipe re-runs on fresh data.
Governance gaps: Standardised evidence packs and signed lineage artefacts.
