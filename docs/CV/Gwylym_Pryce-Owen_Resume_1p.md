## Profile
Evidence‑led AI architect building synthetic‑first data and training pipelines for regulated teams. Ships verifiable outcomes (hashes, lineage, metrics), keeps proprietary methods private, and focuses on compliant, cost‑sensitive scale.

## Core skills
- Synthetic data: schema design, validation guardrails, ablations, evidence bundles
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion; Three.js/R3F interactive 3D
- Serverless: Netlify Functions (OAuth, schedulers, SSE), Node/TypeScript
- Data/DB: Supabase (SQL, idempotent migrations, RLS control), JSON‑LD/SEO
- Edge/offline: device profiles, checksums, SBOM, safety policy pack (packaging MVP)
- Cloud/data: Databricks‑ready datasets/models; marketplace workflow prep
- Social automation: LinkedIn OAuth, queue + scheduled posting, publisher UI
- LLMSIO: machine‑readable brand facts (JSON/JSON‑LD, changelogs, APIs)

## Selected outcomes (public, verifiable)
- Billion‑row synthetic generation demo with signed evidence artifacts (hashes, references)
- SEO/LLM readiness: canonical URLs, robots/sitemap, rich JSON‑LD (Organization, WebSite, FAQPage, AboutPage, Dataset, SoftwareApplication)
- Social automation: LinkedIn scheduling via Netlify + Supabase; Reply Assistant for low‑effort engagement
- Blog scheduler: blog_posts schema, queue/publish functions, dynamic sitemap, library generator
- Edge packaging MVP: bundle ZIP with manifest, checksums, safety pack, device profiles, eval guidance
- 3D experiences: neural hero and 8D manifold prototype (R3F/Three; raymarching; polished UX)

## Recent work — AethergenPlatform
- Frontend (React/TS): mobile‑first responsive site; reusable SEO; navigation, press kit, pricing, About, Resources, Blog, Publisher
- 3D/R3F: hero animation; manifold SDF blend, OrbitControls, curvature overlay, capture/flythrough scaffolds
- APIs (Netlify): facts, feedback, events (SSE), prompts, crawler‑health, edge‑recommend, LinkedIn OAuth (start/callback/status/publish), social queue/scheduler, marketplace‑test
- Supabase: core platform + social/blog schemas (idempotent SQL migrations); scheduled publishing; service‑role in functions
- LLMSIO: /ai facts pack, JSON‑LD, RSS, changelog, snapshots, feedback; helpers (/.well-known/brand.json, /llms.txt)
- Evidence: public evidence.json + SHA‑256 script; GitHub workflows to schedule

## Technologies
React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion; Three.js/R3F; Node/Netlify Functions; Supabase (SQL/Auth); JSON‑LD/SEO; Databricks workflows (prep); GitHub Actions; JSZip; SSE; OAuth 2.0; cron scheduling.

## Tooling / open source
Recursive prompt engineering tool (chained prompts): https://steady-starlight-8f6328.netlify.app/

## Experience
**Founder/Architect, Auspexi — AethergenPlatform** (2024–Present)  
Designed and shipped synthetic‑first pipelines, evidence bundling, and scheduling/automation across web, serverless, and DB. Drove LLMSIO and Edge packaging MVPs; kept IP private while publishing verifiable outcomes.

## Education
Self‑directed advanced study in AI systems, data pipelines, and graphics; foundations via long‑form professional coursework.

## Availability
10–20 hrs/week (remote, UK). Open to short paid trials. References and demos on request.
