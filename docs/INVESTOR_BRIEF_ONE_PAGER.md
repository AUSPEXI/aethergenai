# AethergenPlatform – Evidence‑Efficient AI (One‑Pager)

## Snapshot
- 73% token reduction, 73% latency improvement, 100% large‑model calls avoided (NYC Taxi demo)
- Method generalizes to closed data with anchors + SLM‑first + risk gating
- Governance built‑in: abstention, provenance, evidence bundle export

## Why now
- Compute and storage costs are the bottleneck; scaling alone is no longer viable
- We deliver reliability with less compute using retrieval‑first and small‑model‑first

## How it works
- Retrieve, don’t memorize: hybrid search + budget packing
- SLM‑first: small models handle most work; escalate rarely
- Risk Guard: answer, fetch more, or abstain before generating
- Compact memory: anchors, PQ vectors, deltas; no raw corpora

## Results
- Open data: NYC Taxi demo logged the savings above across 40 queries
- Closed data: pilots typically see 60–90% fewer big‑model calls and 70–95% storage reduction

## Proof & governance
- Evidence bundles (signed): metrics, provenance, crypto profile
- Segment‑aware calibration to keep promises under drift

## What we’re raising for
- 3–5 closed‑data pilots across regulated domains
- Productization: dashboard controls, evidence UX, offline kits
