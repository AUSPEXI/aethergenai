## IP Protection: How to Verify and Operate (SOPS + age)

This repo is configured for local‑first encryption. Use this as a quick checklist before sharing builds or pushing code.

### 1) What must be ignored (already configured)
- `.agekey`, `.passphrase` (do not commit your private key or passphrase)
- `unlocked/` (decrypted scratch space)
- `secure/*.dec`, `secure/*.key`, `secure/*.tmp`
- `docs/ip_manifest.json` (plaintext manifest is local only)

### 2) SOPS config
- File: `.sops.yaml` in repo root
- Uses your age public key to encrypt:
  - `docs/*.(md|pdf|json)` (selective fields or full files as configured)
  - everything under `secure/`
  - any extra rules you add

### 3) Basic workflow
1. Place proprietary plaintext into `secure/` or `docs/` as needed.
2. Run: `sops --encrypt --age <YOUR_AGE_PUBLIC_KEY> <file> > <file>.enc` (or use your lock script).
3. Move decrypted working copies to `unlocked/` (ignored) for local editing.
4. Never commit `unlocked/`.

### 4) Quick verification before sharing
- Inspect `git status`: should not show `.agekey`, `.passphrase`, `unlocked/`, or plaintext manifests.
- Open any encrypted doc in `docs/` or `secure/`: contents should be ciphertext (not readable).
- Search `dist/` (production bundle) for obvious secrets/tokens. Nothing sensitive should appear in built JS.
- Netlify/CI: ensure only public runtime keys (e.g., Supabase anon) are set; never put private keys or passphrases in CI.

### 5) Pre‑push sanity script (optional)
Add a simple script that fails the push if proprietary plaintext is present outside `unlocked/`.

Example (PowerShell):
```
$paths = @('docs/*.md','docs/*.pdf','docs/*.json')
$fail = $false
foreach ($p in $paths) {
  Get-ChildItem $p -Recurse | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_.FullName -notmatch "unlocked" -and (Get-Content $_ -TotalCount 1) -match "AUSPEXI|CONFIDENTIAL|PROPRIETARY") {
      Write-Error "Proprietary marker found in plaintext: $($_.FullName)"; $fail = $true
    }
  }
}
if ($fail) { exit 1 } else { Write-Output "IP pre-push check: OK" }
```

### 6) Recovery
- If plaintext slipped into a commit: rotate keys if needed, purge from history, and replace with encrypted versions.
- Consider GitHub’s secret scanning alerts for common tokens; keep it on.

## Public Messaging Alignment (Aug 2025)

The live site uses some invention names and narrative phrases at a high level (e.g., "8D Causal Manifold Simulator", "Elastic Collision Newton's Cradle", "Radioactive Decay Universe Model", and metaphorical story language). Policy:

- Allowed: High‑level, non‑technical naming to describe achievements and vision on public pages (Home, Technology, About, Press).
- Prohibited: Algorithms, formulas, implementation details, parameters, circuit paths, internal datasets, or reproducible procedures.
- Required: Prefer Honest Framework phrasing (e.g., "we may not be the only ones…") and avoid exclusivity unless independently verifiable.

This policy supersedes older instructions that forbade mentioning names entirely.

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive intellectual property protection strategy for AethergenAI's proprietary zk-SNARK implementation and synthetic data generation algorithms.

## 🔐 Code Protection Measures

### 1. Obfuscation Strategy
- **Variable/Function Names**: All sensitive functions use obfuscated names (e.g., `_0x4f2a`, `_0x2e7f`)
- **Algorithm Hiding**: Core mathematical implementations are hidden behind abstraction layers
- **Configuration Obfuscation**: Circuit paths and cryptographic parameters are obfuscated

### 2. Runtime Protection
- **Environment Detection**: Code behaves differently in development vs production
- **Feature Flags**: Sensitive features are gated behind environment variables
- **Tamper Detection**: Code includes checks for unauthorized modifications

### 3. Proprietary Algorithms
- **Custom Hash Functions**: Proprietary hashing algorithms for circuit inputs
- **Proof Generation**: Unique proof generation methodology
- **Verification Logic**: Custom verification algorithms

## 🛡️ Legal Protection Strategy

### 1. Immediate Actions (Before Patent Filing)
- **Trade Secret Protection**: Treat algorithms as trade secrets
- **NDA Requirements**: All employees/contractors must sign NDAs
- **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive code repositories
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of proprietary algorithms

### 2. Patent Strategy
- **Provisional Patents**: File provisional patents for core algorithms
- **Patent Attorney**: Engage specialized IP attorney for zk-SNARK applications
- **Prior Art Search**: Comprehensive prior art search before filing
- **International Protection**: Consider PCT filing for international protection

### 3. Copyright Protection
- **Source Code Copyright**: Register copyright for all source code
- **Documentation Copyright**: Copyright all technical documentation
- **Algorithm Documentation**: Detailed documentation of proprietary algorithms

## 🔒 Technical Protection

### 1. Code Structure
```
src/services/zksnark/
├── productionZKProofService.ts    # Main production service (obfuscated)
├── realZKProofService.ts         # Development service
└── [protected algorithms]         # Hidden proprietary implementations
```

### 2. Obfuscation Examples
```typescript
// IP Protection: Obfuscated configuration
const _0x4f2a = {
  _0x3e1b: '/circuits/data_integrity.wasm',
  _0x7c4d: '/circuits/data_integrity_final.zkey', 
  _0x9f2e: '/circuits/verification_key.json',
  _0x1a3f: 'groth16',
  _0x5b8c: 'bn128'
};

// IP Protection: Proprietary hash function (obfuscated)
const _0x2e7f = (data: string): string => {
  const _0x4a1b = 0x7f4a7c16;
  let _0x8c3d = _0x4a1b;
  // ... proprietary implementation
};
```

### 3. Environment-Based Protection
```typescript
// Production vs Development behavior
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  // Use real zk-SNARK implementation
  return await generateRealProof(input);
} else {
  // Use fallback for development
  return generateMockProof(input);
}
```
