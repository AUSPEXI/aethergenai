## **THE GARDENER WHO BUILT A TECH EMPIRE:**
### **48-Year-Old Autistic Self-Learner Achieves World Record in Synthetic Data While Working 120-Hour Weeks**

**August 15, 2025** - In what may be the most unlikely tech success story in history, a 48-year-old autistic self-learner who spent over two years working 10-hour days as a gardener has achieved a world record in synthetic data generation while simultaneously building a revolutionary technology company.

## **THE STORY BEHIND THE BREAKTHROUGH**

### **From 25-Year Partnership to Complete Devastation**
Gwylym Pryce-Owen, founder of Auspexi, experienced a complete life reset when his 25-year relationship and business partnership ended. Seeking to rebuild, he moved to Cairo, Egypt for three years, living a semi-retired lifestyle while helping a Norwegian friend with digital marketing and piecing back the parts of himself he had compromised away.

### **Love, Crypto, and Everything Lost**
During this period, Pryce-Owen met his future wife and got engaged. However, his attempt to return to the UK through aggressive cryptocurrency trading ended in disaster. When the market crashed, he tried to recoup losses with futures trading, losing everything in just three days.

### **The 120-Hour Week Grind**
With only enough money for a flight back to the UK, Pryce-Owen faced the most challenging period of his life. For over two years, he worked 10 hours a day as a gardener, then came home and worked on Auspexi for another 10+ hours. This resulted in 120-hour work weeks without complaint.

"The physical grind of gardening nearly broke me," says Pryce-Owen. "But it also transformed me. 10 hours a day of manual labor gave me strength I never knew I had, both physically and mentally."

### **The Phoenix Rises**
Today, Pryce-Owen has given up gardening and is leading a tech revolution through synthetic data. His company, Auspexi, has achieved what was previously considered impossible: generating 1 BILLION synthetic records while maintaining 100% quality compliance.

## **WHY THIS STORY MATTERS**

### **The Human Element**
"This isn't just a tech story," says Pryce-Owen. "It's a human story about resilience, determination, and never giving up. I worked 120-hour weeks while doing manual labor because I knew my day would come. The universe was teaching me lessons I needed to learn."

### **Autism as Competitive Advantage**
Pryce-Owen credits his autism and self-learning abilities as key competitive advantages. "I don't do well in classroom settings, but I can learn anything I need to know. This allowed me to pivot and adapt throughout my journey."

### **Physical and Mental Transformation**
The physical demands of gardening work resulted in above-average physicality for his age, while the mental challenges of building a company during such adversity created unprecedented mental toughness.
