# Spin(8)-Equivariant, Clifford-Aware Layer (Design Note)

Goals:
- Respect Spin(8)/SO(8) symmetry for spinor/vector features
- Provide differentiable Clifford ops: geometric product, inner/outer, reversion

Components:
- Feature types: multivectors (graded), spinors, vectors
- Ops: grade projection, geometric product via basis blades, Hodge dual
- Equivariance: constrain weights to commute with Spin(8) action; use irreps

API sketch:
- Inputs: {x_multivector, x_spinor}
- Params: irrep-tied blocks; projection mixers
- Output: same typed tuple, preserving grading and chirality flags

Notes:
- Start with small basis (restricted blades) for tractability
- Validate on identity suites before numeric PDE tasks
