# Spinor + 8D Manifold Corpus (Seed)

Scope: public, citable material to ground retrieval and training tasks. Research tooling only; not a cryptographic primitive.

## Topics
- Clifford algebras Cℓ(n), geometric product, reversion, grade projections
- Spin groups Spin(n), Spin(8) triality; SO(8) representations
- Dirac operators, spin connections, parallel transport on Riemannian manifolds
- Simple 8D geometries (products of spheres/tori), eigen problems for toy Dirac operators
- Fierz identities, representation decompositions, chirality

## Tasks
- Identity checking and counterexample search (symbolic)
- Representation decomposition and triality mapping (symbolic)
- Dirac eigen toy problems on simple 8D charts (numeric)
- Frame/coordinate transforms and chirality tracking (symbolic+numeric)

## Safety
- Mark outputs “research only; not security claims.”
- Preserve citations; export step-by-step derivations.

Status: Ready to curate references and ingest.
