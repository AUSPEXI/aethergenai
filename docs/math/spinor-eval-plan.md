# Spinor + 8D Evaluation Plan

## Tasks
1) Identities & algebra
- Verify Clifford algebra identities, Fierz rearrangements.
- Representation decompositions for Spin(8); triality mappings.

2) Dirac toy problems
- Compute eigenvalues for Dirac operator on simple 8D product manifolds (e.g., T^8, S^2×T^6) with simplifying assumptions.
- Compare numeric approximations vs references.

3) Geometry operations
- Frame transforms and parallel transport across charts; chirality tracking.

## Metrics
- Identity verification accuracy (held-out set)
- Counterexample discovery rate
- Time-to-solution (median), token/compute cost
- Numerical error (L2 relative) for eigen tasks

## Artifacts
- Notebook examples, dataset cards, and signed run metrics
- “Research only” headers and citation exports
