<h1>Ablation Testing Explained: What Actually Moves the Needle</h1>
<p>Most improvements vanish under scrutiny. Ablations reveal which modules and features truly matter. AethergenPlatform automates ablation design, execution, and reporting—so product decisions rest on effect sizes, not anecdotes.</p>

<h2>Why Ablate</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Distinguish signal from noise</li>
  <li>Guide roadmap toward high‑leverage components</li>
  <li>Communicate value with clear deltas</li>
</ul>

<h2>Patterns</h2>
<ul>
  <li>One‑at‑a‑time feature drops</li>
  <li>Module on/off toggles</li>
  <li>Interaction checks and stress sweeps</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>We publish deltas with confidence intervals and include the ablation trace in the evidence bundle. Reviewers can audit what changed performance and by how much.</p>

<h2>Tie‑In</h2>
<p>Benchmarks and Reporting in AethergenPlatform generate the tables and plots; Packaging attaches them to releases for buyers.</p>
