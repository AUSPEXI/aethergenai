<h1>Dataset Cards and Model Cards: Evidence Buyers Can Trust</h1>
<p>Cards summarise capability and limits; evidence bundles verify claims. AethergenPlatform generates both—so reviewers can skim the card and dive into signed metrics when it matters.</p>

<h2>What Cards Should Contain</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Intended use and limitations</li>
  <li>Key metrics and probes</li>
  <li>Lineage and versioning</li>
  <li>Links to evidence bundle and quickstart</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tie‑In</h2>
<p>Reporting outputs cards alongside evidence and attaches both to releases. Buyers get the narrative and the facts—together.</p>
