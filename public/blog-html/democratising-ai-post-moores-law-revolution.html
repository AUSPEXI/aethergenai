<h1>Efficient AI Beyond Moore’s Law</h1> <p><em>By Gwylym Owen — 40–60 min read</em></p> <p>Think of a chef perfecting a recipe—more ingredients don’t always mean a better dish; it’s about optimizing flavors with what’s on hand. As large language model (LLM) gains from hardware compute plateau, the AI industry faces a turning point. Endless scaling is no longer viable, and efficiency is the new frontier. AethergenPlatform rises to this challenge with a systematic approach: <strong>schema-first generation</strong> to craft precise data, <strong>optimization-led training</strong> to refine models, and <strong>evidence-anchored operations</strong> to ensure measurable outcomes. Every change is tested at operating points (OPs), every artifact signed for audit, offering a solution for regulated teams needing performance without guesswork. This capability is, poised to address the compute plateau head-on.</p> <h2>Executive Summary</h2> <p>Scaling compute endlessly is no longer a given. Efficiency wins via <strong>schema-first generation</strong>, <strong>optimization-led training</strong>, and <strong>evidence-anchored operations</strong>. AethergenPlatform delivers optimization without guesswork: every change measured at operating points, every artifact signed and ready for audit. This approach can benefit regulated industries like healthcare and finance, where resource constraints and compliance demands collide</p> <h2>Principles</h2> <p>These guiding lights drive efficiency. <strong>Optimize before you scale: reduce waste upstream</strong> saves compute early. <strong>Measure where it matters: operate at fixed budgets (OPs)</strong> focuses on impact. <strong>Protect privacy: synthetic-first, probes, optional DP</strong> safeguards data. <strong>Prove improvements: effect sizes with confidence intervals</strong> validates gains.
