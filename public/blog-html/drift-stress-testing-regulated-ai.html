<h1>Drift & Stress Testing: Evidence‑Led Stability in Regulated AI</h1>
<p>Regulated AI must remain stable across time, populations, and operating conditions. AethergenPlatform designs drift/stress suites and reports effect sizes so risk teams can accept models—and know when to roll back.</p>

<h2>Test Suite Design</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Time drift (weekly/monthly windows)</li>
  <li>Domain shifts (product/segment)</li>
  <li>Corruptions (vision/text)</li>
  <li>Fault injection (dropout/jitter)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reporting and Gates</h2>
<p>We summarise sensitivity with effect sizes and confidence intervals; fail‑closed rules prevent risky promotions. Evidence bundles capture results with signatures.</p>

<h2>Tie‑In to AethergenPlatform</h2>
<p>Benchmarks orchestrate tests; Reporting exports signed results; Packaging links bundles to releases so auditors can trace performance across time.</p>
