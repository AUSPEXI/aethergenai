<h1>Offline Edge Audit: SBOM, Checksums, and QR‑Verified Manifests</h1>
<p>Air‑gapped deployments still need strong audit trails. AethergenPlatform packages offline edge artifacts with SBOMs, signed manifests, and QR‑encoded hashes so field engineers and auditors can verify what’s running—without a network.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Factories, fleets, and defence environments often operate partially or fully offline. Trust depends on reproducible builds, verifiable artifacts, and on‑site checks.</p>

<h2>How We Package</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SBOM for binaries and models</li>
  <li>SHA‑256 manifest with signatures</li>
  <li>QR‑encoded manifest hash for handheld verification</li>
  <li>Device profile guidance (VRAM, thermal, power)</li>
</ul>

<h2>AethergenPlatform Tie‑In</h2>
<p>Packaging generates the manifest; Reporting archives the evidence bundle (utility, privacy, lineage). Teams can prove provenance and integrity on‑site and in procurement.</p>
