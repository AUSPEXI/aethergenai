<h1>Enterprise Pricing that Aligns with Evidence and Outcomes</h1>
<p>Pricing should reflect value delivered—not vague promises. AethergenPlatform ties enterprise pricing to evidence thresholds, SLAs, and managed compute so incentives stay aligned and predictable.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Platform (Tools):</strong> you run compute; we provide generators, benchmarks, and reporting under quotas.</li>
  <li><strong>Enterprise (Managed on Databricks):</strong> we run compute, deliver in Unity Catalog, and attach evidence per release under SLAs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evidence in Contracts</h2>
<p>We declare utility/privacy thresholds and refresh cadence. If a release doesn’t meet gates, it doesn’t ship. Everyone saves time.</p>

<h2>Why Buyers Trust This</h2>
<p>Because every claim is auditable: signed bundles, lineage, and reproducible metrics—no hand‑waving.</p>
