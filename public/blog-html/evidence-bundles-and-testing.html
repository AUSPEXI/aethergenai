<h1>Evidence Bundles & Testing: Trustworthy AI Without Exposing IP</h1>
<p>What we publish (and what we deliberately withhold). Evidence that convinces risk teams while protecting core IP.</p>

<h2>What We Publish</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lineage & hashes:</strong> schema, recipes, artifact checksums</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy/utility:</strong> re‑id, attribute disclosure, task deltas</li>
  <li><strong>Ablations:</strong> which modules matter, and how much</li>
  <li><strong>Limits:</strong> intended use, known failure modes</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Verification</h2>
<p>Bundles are signed and independently verifiable; optional zk‑proofs for privacy bounds. We provide enough to trust and operate without leaking IP.</p>
