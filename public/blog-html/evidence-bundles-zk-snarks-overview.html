<h1>Evidence Bundles and zk‑Proofs: Verifying Claims Without IP Leakage</h1>
<p>Buyers need to verify privacy bounds and performance claims without access to proprietary code. AethergenPlatform ships <em>evidence bundles</em>—signed JSON with metrics, lineage, and ablations—and can add zero‑knowledge proofs to attest privacy constraints without leaking internals.</p>

<h2>What’s Inside an Evidence Bundle</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lineage and recipe hashes</li>
  <li>Utility and privacy metrics</li>
  <li>Ablation traces and effect sizes</li>
  <li>Artifact checksums and signatures</li>
</ul>

<h2>Optional zk‑Proofs</h2>
<p>For sensitive deployments, we attach zk‑proofs that demonstrate bounds (e.g., DP ε thresholds or aggregate constraints) while keeping raw data and parameters hidden.</p>

<h2>Our Difference</h2>
<p>Evidence is a <em>first‑class artifact</em>. We automate bundle generation in CI, and buyers can verify signatures and hashes independently. This turns security and compliance from a meeting into a check command.</p>
