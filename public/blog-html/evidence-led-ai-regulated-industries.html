<h1>Evidence‑Led AI in Regulated Industries: A Practical Guide</h1>
<p>If you work in a regulated organisation, you’ve felt the tension: the business wants AI yesterday, while compliance, privacy, and procurement demand proof. AethergenPlatform solves this by making <strong>evidence the default</strong>—every dataset/model ships with signed metrics, lineage, and privacy probes buyers can verify.</p>

<h2>What “Evidence‑Led” Means</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lineage:</strong> schema, versions, recipe hashes, artifact checksums</li>
  <li><strong>Utility:</strong> task accuracy deltas vs baselines (AUC/KS/PR‑AUC)</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> membership‑inference and attribute‑disclosure probes; optional DP (ε, δ)</li>
  <li><strong>Ablation:</strong> what changes outcomes and by how much (effect sizes)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Privacy Bit (Plain Language)</h2>
<p>We default to <em>synthetic‑first</em>: learn patterns from minimal/redacted samples, then generate new records that behave like the real thing without carrying identifiers. When needed, we apply differential privacy and publish probes to show acceptable risk.</p>

<h2>A Concrete Example</h2>
<p>Credit‑risk under Basel governance: we build a synthetic transaction graph with risk features and typology injection; train/evaluate; then ship a signed bundle covering utility, privacy, drift stability, and ablations. Reviewers get facts, not slideware.</p>

<h2>How AethergenPlatform Implements This</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Schema Designer:</strong> define fields, constraints, privacy levels</li>
  <li><strong>Generator:</strong> produce synthetic datasets at the volumes you need with ε control</li>
  <li><strong>Benchmarks & Ablation:</strong> run task evaluations, stress, and ablations</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> export a <em>signed evidence bundle</em> and model/dataset cards</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why We’re Different</h2>
<p>Evidence is a <em>first‑class artifact</em>—automated in CI and independently verifiable. We protect IP while proving claims (optional zk‑proofs for privacy bounds), so adoption moves fast without blind trust.</p>
