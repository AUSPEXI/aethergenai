<h1>Managed Delivery on Databricks: SLAs with Evidence</h1>
<p>Run less, get more. With AethergenPlatform Enterprise, we operate on your Databricks workspace and deliver datasets/models in Unity Catalog—each release backed by a signed evidence bundle and governed by SLAs.</p>

<h2>Scope</h2>
<ul>
  <li>We run compute and orchestration</li>
  <li>You receive Delta tables, models, and evidence bundles</li>
  <li>Change windows, rollback, and named approvals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Alignment</h2>
<p>SLAs reference evidence thresholds. If a release fails privacy or utility gates, it doesn’t deploy. That’s how we protect your brand and keep auditors happy.</p>
