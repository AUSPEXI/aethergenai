<h1>Phoenix Rising: A Founder’s Journey</h1>
<p>Behind the platform is a straightforward story: reset, focus, and ship. Long weeks, measured progress, and a commitment to evidence over hype.</p>

<h2>A disciplined build</h2>
<p>I rebuilt AethergenPlatform one clear decision at a time—tight scope, strong guardrails, and honest trade-offs. The result is an engine that generates synthetic data, benchmarks models, and ships evidence buyers can verify.</p>

<h2>What mattered</h2>
<p>Clear requirements, small validated steps, and transparent outcomes. That’s the through‑line from idea to working system—and why we publish signed metrics, lineage, and limits with every release.</p>
