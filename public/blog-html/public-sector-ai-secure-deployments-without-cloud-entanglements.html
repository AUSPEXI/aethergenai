<h1>Public Sector AI: Secure Deployments Without Cloud Entanglements</h1>
<p><em>By Gwylym Owen — 18–24 min read</em></p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Public sector teams need AI that works in <strong>restricted</strong> networks and <strong>air‑gapped</strong> sites. AethergenPlatform packages models and datasets with SBOMs, signed manifests, and offline dashboards so procurement and security can approve without cloud dependencies.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>No live internet; removable media only.</li>
  <li>On‑prem verification of signatures/hashes.</li>
  <li>Offline evidence: HTML/PDF dashboards.</li>
  <li>Access controls and audit trails.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Delivery</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Signed tarballs with manifests and SBOMs.</li>
  <li>Policy packs and device profiles.</li>
  <li>QR‑verifiable manifest labels.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Evidence</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Operating‑point utility with CIs.</li>
  <li>Segment stability summaries.</li>
  <li>Privacy probe reports; optional DP budgets.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Case Study</h2>
<p>A lab deployed detectors inside an enclave; security verified signatures, opened offline dashboards, and filed SBOMs. Approval took days, not months.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<details>
  <summary>Can we receive private annexes?</summary>
  <p>Yes—bundled separately with their own manifests.</p>
 </details>
<details>
  <summary>How do we handle updates?</summary>

 </details>

<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>Air‑gapped and restricted environments demand products that carry their own proof. <strong>AethergenPlatform</strong> delivers exactly that.</p>
