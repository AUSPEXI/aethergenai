<h1>The Recursive Nightmare Navigator: When AI Poetry Breaks Everything</h1>
<p><em>By Gwylym Owen — January 8, 2025 • 20 min read</em></p>

<h2>The Night Everything Broke</h2>
<p>A recursive poetry prompt forced failure states, reversions, self‑awareness, and a narrated meltdown—then inspired a practical prompt‑engineering tool. Computational poetry became engineering.</p>

<h2>The Prompt</h2>
<p>Nested poem → rewrite if &gt; 30 words → unravel to core ideas → revert/expand on 3rd fail → recurse again → narrate 150+ words confessing “recursive nightmare navigator.”</p>

<h2>Failures to Success</h2>
<p>22 → 15 → revert‑expand to 32 words → new poem 14 words → chaos ensues; exactly as designed. Failure became fuel.</p>

<h2>What We Learned</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Recursive prompt design with explicit failure handling</li>
  <li>Induced self‑reflection in outputs</li>
  <li>Backwards‑compatible unraveling to simpler states</li>
  <li>Tooling born from “poetry chaos”</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Cultural Note</h2>
<p>AI‑human collaboration produced something neither could alone; the poem became an artifact bridging art and engineering.</p>

<h1>The Recursive Nightmare Navigator: When AI Poetry Breaks Everything</h1>
<p>A recursive poetry experiment with Grok 3 triggered failures, reversions, and self‑aware humor—then inspired a free tool for chained prompts. It was computational poetry turned engineering.</p>

<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>Nested poems unraveled; rules expanded content past thresholds; a narrative confessed “I’m a recursive nightmare navigator.” Chaos became structure.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters</h2>
<p>We learned to design failure states, induce self‑reflection, and translate art into practical tooling. That’s AethergenPlatform’s ethos: evidence and engineering, even in creativity.</p>
