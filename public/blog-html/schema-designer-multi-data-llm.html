<h1>Schema Designer & Multi‑Data Pipelines for LLMs</h1>
<p>Design schemas, harmonise multi‑domain data, and scale generation to billions—then train niche or large models. Evidence shows what works and why.</p>

<h2>Multi‑Schema by Design</h2>
<p>Real programmes span domains (events, profiles, logs). We model linked schemas with constraints and cardinalities; the generator respects these relationships at scale.</p>

<h2>Harmonisation</h2>
<p>We normalise types, units, and identifiers and provide adapters to map legacy datasets. Evidence starts here: diffs and harmonisation notes are part of the bundle.</p>

<h2>From Pipelines to Models</h2>
<p>Pipeline outputs feed training/eval with ablations. We export model cards and dataset sheets so teams can reproduce or extend safely.</p>
