<h1>Unity Catalog CI/CD: Automating Packaging and Listing Updates</h1>
<p>Reliable listings come from reliable pipelines. AethergenPlatform integrates packaging, evidence export, and Marketplace updates into CI/CD so every release meets the same standard.</p>

<h2>Pipeline Stages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Build artifacts and run Delta OPTIMIZE</li>
  <li>Run benchmarks and ablations; export evidence</li>
  <li>Package zip (manifest + SBOM + evidence)</li>
  <li>Push to Unity Catalog; refresh listing metadata</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gates</h2>
<p>We fail closed on privacy and utility thresholds. Promotions require passing evidence, not manual judgement calls.</p>

<h2>Why Buyers Care</h2>
<p>Consistency reduces risk. Reviewers can trust that each version followed the same checks and ships with signed artifacts they can verify.</p>
