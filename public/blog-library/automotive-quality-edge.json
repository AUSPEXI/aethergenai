  "bodyMd": "## Why Edge for Quality\n\nLatency, bandwidth, and privacy constraints make edge the right fit for visual inspection and optimisation loops. Offline operation is common; packages must be verifiable and serviceable on site.\n\n## Reference Solution\n- **Defect detection**: surface/assembly‑level CV models tuned per line and camera geometry.\n- **Optimisation loop**: feedback into station parameters (lighting, speed) under safety envelopes.\n- **Packaging**: checksums + SBOM + signed manifest; device profiles (VRAM/thermal).\n- **Evidence**: QA cards with per‑defect ROC, false‑call cost, and drift monitors.\n\n## KPIs & Measurement\n- Detection sensitivity/specificity per defect class.\n- False call rate and rework minutes saved.\n- Throughput impact at target sensitivity (units/hour).\n- Drift alerts (camera change, seasonal textures).\n\n## Rollout Plan\n1. Start with one line, one defect class; collect baseline metrics.\n2. Validate against golden set; tune thresholds for cost‑optimal performance.\n3. Expand to additional classes/stations; introduce drift monitors.\n4. Publish signed evidence for QA sign‑off and buyer review.\n\n## Edge Operations\n- Health checks and hot‑swap models.\n- On‑device cache with periodic sync; offline first.\n- QR‑encoded manifest hash for on‑site audit.\n\n## Platform Tie‑In\nUse Packaging to assemble the offline bundle and Reporting to export evidence. QA teams can accept/reject releases using the evidence card while operations roll out safely."
