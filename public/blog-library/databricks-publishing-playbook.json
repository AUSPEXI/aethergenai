  "bodyMd": "## Objective\n\nConvert validated datasets/models into Marketplace listings with enterprise‑ready packaging and evidence.\n\n## Packaging Steps\n1. **Create Delta tables** with partitioning; run `OPTIMIZE` and `Z‑ORDER` on query keys.\n2. **Register in Unity Catalog**: set owner, grants, and attach tags (domain, license, sensitivity).\n3. **Generate evidence bundle**: utility, privacy, ablations, lineage; sign manifest.\n4. **Produce quickstart notebook**: load table/model, sample queries, and guardrails.\n5. **Define commercial terms**: license, usage rights, support SLAs, update cadence.\n\n## Listing Checklist\n- Title/summary clearly state domain and intended use.\n- Table schemas documented with column descriptions and units.\n- Evidence bundle attached and referenced.\n- Notebook validated on a clean workspace.\n- Contact and support path included.\n\n## Quality Gates (Fail‑Closed)\n- **Utility ≥ threshold** (task‑specific KPIs).\n- **Privacy ≤ bound** (re‑id/attribute probes; DP budgets if applicable).\n- **Docs complete** (model card/datasheet; responsible use).\n\n## Example Snippet\n```sql\nOPTIMIZE catalog.schema.table ZORDER BY (account_id, ts);\nCOMMENT ON COLUMN catalog.schema.table.amount IS 'Minor‑unit integer (pence/cents)';\n```\n\n## Platform Tie‑In\nUse the Reporting module to export the bundle and Packaging to assemble the signed zip (manifest + SBOM + evidence). Upload to Unity Catalog and complete the Marketplace form with direct links to the quickstart notebook and docs."
