Built to run offline on RTX‑accelerated workstations and edge servers, they integrate with our synthetic data and LLM training tools. Each package ships with checksums and SBOM; optional evidence bundle cards are available for regulated reviews.\n\n## Why Edge, Why Now\nEdge computing reduces latency, mitigates cloud exposure, and enables operation in air‑gapped environments. Customers use it to drive **real‑time** decisions with strict compliance requirements.\n\n## Packages\n- **Edge Starter (£1,499)** — VRAM‑aware device profiles, checksums manifest, safety policy pack, minimal evaluation recipes.\n- **Edge Pro (£4,999)** — Adds SBOM, expanded evaluation datasets, offline documentation bundle, license watermarking for adapters.\n- **Edge Enterprise (Custom)** — Air‑gapped deployment guidance, signing/verify workflows, audit log formats with rotation, SLAs.\n\n## Architecture (Offline‑Capable)\n- **Data ingress**: hot folder or secure socket→ preproc\n- **Model runtime**: device‑profile aware; GPU/CPU fallback\n- **Policy layer**: safety envelopes + signatures\n- **Audit**: event log + evidence bundle hash\n\n## Industry Use Cases\n### Automotive\n- **Defect detection** on lines with sub‑second latency\n- **Optimisation** loops for yield and throughput\n- Evidence: KS/TV alignment, task lift, drift stability\n\n### Healthcare (Q1 2025)\n- **Claims fraud** triage with offline review packs\n- Evidence: DP budgets, disclosure probes, reviewer notes\n\n### Financial Services (Q2 2025)\n- **Transaction fraud** signals and risk scoring\n- Evidence: stability under noise, AUC/FPR trade‑offs\n\n## Governance & Evidence\n- Checksums/SBOM, signed manifest, optional notarisation\n- Bundle contains provenance, privacy, utility, ablations, card\n\n## Get Started\nPilot one line/use case; expand once evidence gates pass.\n\n[View Pricing →](/pricing)  |  [Contact Sales →](/contact)\n"
