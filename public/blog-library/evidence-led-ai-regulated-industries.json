  "bodyMd": "## Why Evidence First\nIf you work in a regulated organisation, the fastest path to ‘yes’ isn’t a demo—**it’s a signed bundle of facts**. We build with a simple rule: evidence beats opinions. Our bundles let risk, compliance, and engineering review the exact same artefacts and move together.\n\n## Plain‑English Summary\n- We show where the data/model came from (provenance)\n- We quantify privacy risk and set budgets before anything ships\n- We prove that it works (utility) and why (ablations)\n- We state where it should/shouldn’t be used (cards)\nAll of it is machine‑verifiable and human‑readable.\n\n## What’s in the Bundle (Signed)\n- **Provenance**: schema + version, recipe hash, artifact checksums\n- **Privacy**: re‑id, attribute disclosure, membership inference; DP budgets (ε, δ)\n- **Utility**: distribution alignment (KS/TV) + task metrics (AUC/F1/MAE)\n- **Ablations**: module and budget effects with sensitivity curves\n- **Cards**: intended use, limits, responsible‑use notes\n\n## How It Feels to Implement\nA typical review meeting changes from “trust us” to: *“Here’s the signed evidence, here are the gates we met, here’s what happens when we tweak the privacy budget.”* Decisions get made in the room.\n\n## Workflow on AethergenPlatform\n1. **Schema Designer** — model entities/fields, set privacy levels\n2. **Generator** — deterministic runs with DP budgets and recipe hashes\n3. **Benchmarks/Ablation** — compute task/align metrics; run toggles\n4. **Reporting** — export the signed evidence JSON\n\n## Example: Credit Risk (Basel)\n- Synthetic transaction graph with typology injection (late‑pay, spikes)\n- Evidence: AUC lift ≥ 0.03 vs baseline; re‑id ≤ 1%\n- Ablation: feature family X drives most lift under ε = 0.8; budget trade‑off shown as a curve\n\n## Who This Helps\n- **Banks/Fintech**: credit, fraud, onboarding risk\n- **Healthcare**: claims triage, clinical ops, audit trails\n- **Critical Infrastructure/Defence**: offline/edge, evidence for procurement\n\n## Start Small, Then Scale\nPick one KPI, run the bundle, and review jointly with compliance. When gates pass, promote to pilot.\n\n[View Pricing →](/pricing)  |  [Contact Sales →](/contact)"
