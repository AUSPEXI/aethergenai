  "bodyMd": "## Why Evidence First\nProcurement can’t assess opaque systems. We publish **signed, verifiable bundles** so risk, compliance, and engineering can decide with facts, not promises.\n\n## What’s in the Bundle (Signed)\n- **Provenance**: schema + version, recipe hash, artifact checksums\n- **Privacy**: re‑id, attribute disclosure, membership inference; DP budgets (ε, δ)\n- **Utility**: distribution alignment (KS/TV) + task metrics (AUC/F1/MAE)\n- **Ablations**: module and budget effects with sensitivity curves\n- **Cards**: intended use, limits, responsible‑use notes\n\n## Workflow on AethergenPlatform\n1) **Schema Designer** — model entities/fields, set privacy levels\n2) **Generator** — deterministic runs with DP budgets and recipe hashes\n3) **Benchmarks/Ablation** — compute task/align metrics; run toggles\n4) **Reporting** — export the signed evidence JSON\n\n## Example: Credit Risk (Basel)\n- Synthetic transaction graph with typology injection (late‑pay, spikes)\n- Evidence shows AUC lift ≥ 0.03 vs baseline; re‑id ≤ 1%\n- Ablation reveals feature family that drives lift under budget ε=0.8\n\n## Start Small, Then Scale\nPick one KPI, run the bundle, and review jointly with compliance. Promote when gates pass.\n\n[View Pricing →](/pricing)  |  [Contact Sales →](/contact)"
