Synthetic graphs let teams test ideas without handling raw PII.\n\n## What We Generate\n- Accounts, merchants, cards with realistic topology\n- Typology injection: smurfing, velocity spikes, rings\n- Risk features for downstream models\n\n## Evaluation\n- Detection lift vs baseline\n- False‑positive balance\n- Drift/stability over time\n\n[View Pricing →](/pricing) | [Contact Sales →](/contact)"
