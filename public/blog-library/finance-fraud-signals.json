  "bodyMd": "## Why Synthetic for AML\n\nLabelled fraud is scarce and risky to share. We generate **transaction graphs** that preserve behaviour while stripping PII—so teams can iterate without waiting on data approvals. Evidence bundles accompany each release so risk teams can approve with facts.\n\n## Domain Model\n- **Nodes**: customers, accounts, cards, merchants, devices, IPs.\n- **Edges**: payments/transfers with timestamps, channel, amount, MCC, geo.\n- **Distributions**: degree, dwell, inter‑arrival, amount bands; community structure.\n\n## Typology Injection (Parameterized)\n- **Smurfing**: split deposits under control limit; parameterise window and banding.\n- **Velocity spikes**: rapid multi‑merchant card hits; tune burst length and cooldown.\n- **Cash‑out rings**: fan‑in to hub, then fan‑out; control hub degree and timing.\n- **Mule networks**: device/IP reuse across identities; adjustable reuse rate.\n- **A2A daisy chains**: layered transfers with time‑shift to evade heuristics.\n\n## Feature Engineering\n- Velocity and burstiness by channel and MCC.\n- Merchant dispersion and entropy; geodesic distance anomalies.\n- Device/browser fingerprint reuse; IP reputation; ASN risk.\n- Community metrics (betweenness, clustering, k‑core) for hubs and bridges.\n- Counterparty risk cascades and second‑order exposure.\n\n## Training & Evaluation\n- Baselines: rule engines; models: graph rankers, gradient boosting, GNNs.\n- Metrics: **AUC/PR‑AUC**, **F1**, **KS**; calibration and lift charts.\n- Cost framing: false‑positive delta at fixed recall; review queue volume.\n- Drift: time‑sliced evaluation; seasonality and product launches.\n\n## Privacy & Governance\n- Synthetic‑first with optional DP budgets (ε, δ).\n- Probes: membership inference and attribute disclosure.\n- Evidence bundle: lineage, parameters, metrics, probes, and artifact checksums.\n\n## Example Analytics\n- Onboarding risk: merchant cohort lift vs device/IP history.\n- Account take‑over: sudden device change + velocity spike alerts.\n- Exchange AML: chain hop count and mixer proximity features.\n\n## Platform Tie‑In\nUse the Generator to produce graphs with typologies, Benchmarks to evaluate models and rules, and Reporting to export a signed evidence bundle for audit and buyer review."
