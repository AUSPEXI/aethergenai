  "bodyMd": "## From Starlings to Swarms: 8D Safety for Thousands of Drones\n\nCoordinating large swarms demands real‑time safety, evidence, and offline readiness. Auspexi’s approach combines 8D state modeling with control techniques (e.g., CBF/RTA patterns) and evidence bundles to validate performance at scale — including edge deployment.\n\n### What’s Inside\n- 8D state representation and safety envelopes\n- Evidence bundles for auditability\n- Offline/edge operation for field scenarios\n\n### Why It Matters\nSafety‑critical deployments (inspection, logistics, public safety) need demonstrable assurance and resilient ops without always‑on cloud.\n\n[Contact Sales →](/contact)"
