  "bodyMd": "## Why a Harness?\n\nTeams need **repeatable** evaluations without yak‑shaving. Our harness runs standard tasks with deterministic settings and produces exportable evidence.\n\n## What You Get\n- Model registry with ready‑to‑run presets (HF + proprietary)\n- Ablation injectors (toggle modules, privacy budgets)\n- CSV/JSON export and evidence cards\n\n## Typical Workflow\n1. Select models and recipes\n2. Run harness → export summary\n3. Decide with facts (utility, stability, privacy)\n\n## Evidence Outputs\n- Task deltas vs baseline\n- Stability under noise/faults\n- Privacy probe summaries\n\n[View Pricing →](/pricing) | [Contact Sales →](/contact)"
