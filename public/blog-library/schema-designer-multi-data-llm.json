Templates accelerate reuse.\n\n## Pipelines\nSnapshot end‑to‑end configs (preproc, joins, feature families) with digests; changes are tracked and auditable.\n\n## LLM Training/Eval\nDeterministic snapshots feed training/eval recipes so runs are reproducible; evaluation evidence is exported with each snapshot.\n\n[View Pricing →](/pricing)  |  [Contact Sales →](/contact)",
