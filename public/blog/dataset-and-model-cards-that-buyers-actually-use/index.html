In the AI world, dataset and model cards often read like marketing fluff, leaving buyers—risk teams, engineers, and procurement—guessing. AethergenPlatform flips this, delivering operational cards that are evidence-backed, Unity Catalog-aware, and procurement-ready. These cards help buyers evaluate, adopt, and govern AI assets, speeding up sign-offs and ensuring success from day one. All features are, designed for real-world use in regulated domains like healthcare or finance. Executive Summary Most “cards” read like marketing. Buyers need operational cards that help them evaluate, adopt, and govern AI assets. AethergenPlatform ships dataset and model cards that are evidence-backed, Unity Catalog-aware, and procurement-ready—so risk teams sign faster and engineers succeed on day one. This system is fully operational. What Buyers Actually Need Buyers demand clarity to trust your assets. Each requirement below prevents critical failures and builds trust: Clarity on intended use and limits Prevents misuse in critical applications Evidence at declared operating points Proves performance with confidence intervals Segment stability and drift expectations Ensures reliability over time Data lineage, SBOM, and change-control hooks Supports audits and compliance Install/run SOPs, sample notebooks, and rollback guidance Aids deployment and troubleshooting Clear entitlements, support, and update cadence Sets expectations for ongoing service Imagine an insurer reviewing a fraud-detection model—this checklist drives their decision Clarity on intended use and limits to avoid misuse. Evidence at declared operating points with confidence intervals. Segment stability and drift expectations . Data lineage, SBOM, and change-control hooks . Install/run SOPs, sample notebooks, and rollback guidance . Clear entitlements, support, and update cadence . Dataset Card: Structure A dataset card is a detailed label that provides comprehensive information for buyers. Each component serves a specific purpose: Overview Purpose, domain, and target tasks to set context Schema Entities, relations, fields, types, and vocabularies Quality Coverage, nulls, ranges, and constraint checks Fidelity/Utility Alignment with target tasks and baselines Privacy Probes, budgets (if applicable), and non-goals Packaging Formats and Unity Catalog registration Evidence Metrics, plots, seeds, and hashes Limits Intended use, failure modes, and caveats Support Refresh cadence, contact, and SLAs A healthcare team using a claims dataset would rely on this comprehensive structure Overview : purpose, domain, target tasks. Schema : entities, relations, fields, types, vocabularies. Quality : coverage, nulls, ranges, constraint checks. Fidelity/Utility : alignment with target tasks and baselines. Privacy : probes, budgets (if applicable), non-goals. Packaging : formats, Unity Catalog registration. Evidence : metrics, plots, seeds, hashes. Limits : intended use, failure modes, caveats. Support : refresh cadence, contact, SLAs. Model Card: Structure A model card is a blueprint that guides deployment and governance. Each component addresses critical aspects: Overview Problem, scope, and intended use to frame purpose Training Data Sources, synthetic notes (if any), and constraints Evaluation Operating-point utility with CIs, stability, drift sensitivity Calibration Threshold selection SOP and trade-offs Robustness Corruptions (if relevant) and failure analysis Limits Out-of-scope inputs and known weaknesses Packaging MLflow/ONNX/GGUF, device profiles, example notebooks Evidence Signed bundle manifest, SBOM, and lineage Governance Change-control, rollback, and audit hooks A fraud-detection team would use this comprehensive structure Overview : problem, scope, intended use. Training data : sources, synthetic notes (if any), constraints. Evaluation : operating-point utility with CIs; stability; drift sensitivity. Calibration : threshold selection SOP; trade-offs. Robustness : corruptions (if relevant) and failure analysis. Limits : out-of-scope inputs, known weaknesses. Packaging : MLflow/ONNX/GGUF; device profiles; example notebooks. Evidence : signed bundle manifest; SBOM; lineage. Governance : change-control, rollback, and audit hooks. Evidence-Led Philosophy Cards are not brochures—they’re contracts. Contracts about performance, limits, and support bind promises to reality. Each statement links to a verifiable artifact in the evidence bundle. If the card says “at 1% FPR,” the evidence includes the exact threshold, CI bands, seeds, and configs that reproduce it. Picture a risk team auditing a healthcare model—this rigor wins them over Dataset Card Template (Illustrative) This template structures a dataset card. Each field is presented as a clear label/value line: name: Healthcare Claims (Synthetic) version: 2025.01 purpose: Fraud detection prototyping and evaluation schema: entities, relations, fields quality: coverage, constraints fidelity: marginals, utility privacy: seeds, probes packaging: format, unity_catalog evidence: metrics, plots, manifest limits: not for clinical diagnosis support: refresh, contact name: Healthcare Claims (Synthetic) version: 2025.01 purpose: Fraud detection prototyping and evaluation schema: entities: [patient*, provider*, facility*, claim, line_item, rx] relations: - patient* 1.* claim - claim 1.* line_item fields: - claim: {date: date, pos: code, amount_billed: decimal} quality: coverage: {claim.amount_billed: 100%, line_item.cpt: 99.7%} constraints: [amount_billed>=0, date Model Card Template (Illustrative) This template structures a model card. Each field is presented as a clear label/value line: name: Claims Fraud Detector version: 2025.01 intended_use: triage and analyst prioritization training_data: synthetic claims corpus evaluation: op_1%fpr, stability calibration: method, target robustness: drift, rollback limits: out_of_scope packaging: format, notebook evidence: bundle governance: change_control name: Claims Fraud Detector version: 2025.01 intended_use: triage and analyst prioritization training_data: synthetic claims corpus; see dataset card evaluation: op_1%fpr: {tp:., fp:., ci: [.,.]} stability: {region_delta Unity Catalog Integration Cards tie into governance. Register dataset tables and model functions with grants organizes assets. Attach card metadata as table/model comments for catalog UIs aids discovery. Track lineage from sources to publishable assets ensures traceability. Export an HTML/PDF card with links to evidence artifacts simplifies review. A finance team managing a fraud dataset would use this Register dataset tables and model functions with grants. Attach card metadata as table/model comments for catalog UIs. Track lineage from sources to publishable assets. Export an HTML/PDF card with links to evidence artifacts. Operating Points: Tell Buyers Where to Look Guide buyers with precision. Pick thresholds that map to analyst capacity (alerts/day) aligns with needs. Publish effect sizes and CIs; avoid only AUC/roc rhetoric focuses on impact. Explain segment stability bands; highlight limits ensures reliability. Document rollback triggers and SOPs prepares for issues. A risk team reviewing a model would appreciate this Pick thresholds that map to analyst capacity (alerts/day). Publish effect sizes and CIs; avoid only AUC/roc rhetoric. Explain segment stability bands; highlight limits. Document rollback triggers and SOPs. Card Review Checklist (Internal) Quality control is key. Intended use and non-goals are explicit sets boundaries. Evidence links resolve to signed artifacts ensures trust. Operating points and stability bands match governance aligns metrics. Limits and known failure modes are concrete warns of risks. Support cadence and entitlements are correct commits to service. A QA team would use this Intended use and non-goals are explicit. Evidence links resolve to signed artifacts. Operating points and stability bands match governance. Limits and known failure modes are concrete. Support cadence and entitlements are correct. Case Study: Buyers Who Converted An insurer’s risk committee approved a claims corpus and detector in two weeks. They reproduced utility@OP, inspected segment stability, and filed the SBOM/manifest with procurement. Adoption time dropped from months to days. This process is Common Failure Modes (and Fixes) Avoid pitfalls with these fixes. Vague claims : Replace with OP metrics and CIs; link to plots. No limits stated : Add out-of-scope inputs and known weaknesses. Unclear packaging : Provide install notebooks and Unity Catalog paths. No rollback : Document triggers and scripts; rehearse. Drift ignored : Add monitors and playbooks; include thresholds. A team launching a healthcare model would learn from this Vague claims : Replace with OP metrics and CIs; link to plots. No limits stated : Add out-of-scope inputs and known weaknesses. Unclear packaging : Provide install notebooks and Unity Catalog paths. No rollback : Document triggers and scripts; rehearse. Drift ignored : Add monitors and playbooks; include thresholds. From Card to Contract Cards become commitments. Contractual expectations: refresh cadence, support windows, evidence refresh, and deprecation policies bind agreements. Legal references the card’s version and evidence manifest IDs. A procurement team signing off would use this Evidence Excerpts (Illustrative) These snippets prove performance. metrics/utility@op.json : {op: \"fpr=0.01\", lift_vs_legacy: 0.18, ci: [0.161, 0.202], segments: {\"region\": {\"max_delta\": 0.028}}} shows utility. metrics/stability_by_segment.json : {region: {\"NA\": 0.74, \"EU\": 0.73, \"APAC\": 0.72}, product: {\"A\": 0.77, \"B\": 0.75}} tracks stability. metrics/utility@op.json { \"op\": \"fpr=0.01\", \"lift_vs_legacy\": 0.18, \"ci\": [0.161, 0.202], \"segments\": {\"region\": {\"max_delta\": 0.028}} } metrics/stability_by_segment.json { \"region\": {\"NA\": 0.74, \"EU\": 0.73, \"APAC\": 0.72}, \"product\": {\"A\": 0.77, \"B\": 0.75} } Card Publishing SOP This process ensures quality. Generate evidence; sign and store artifacts builds trust. Draft card from templates; populate with linked metrics adds detail. Legal and QA review; assign version and manifest ID validates. Publish to Unity Catalog and Marketplace listing deploys. Attach to change-control; notify sales/support manages updates. A team launching a dataset would follow this Generate evidence; sign and store artifacts. Draft card from templates; populate with linked metrics. Legal and QA review; assign version and manifest ID. Publish to Unity Catalog and Marketplace listing. Attach to change-control; notify sales/support. Governance Hooks Structure keeps it tight. Card versions align with artifact hashes and SEMVER tracks changes. Promotion gates tied to operating points and stability bands ensures quality. Incident runbooks reference card limits and rollback SOPs prepares for issues. A compliance officer would value this Card versions align with artifact hashes and SEMVER. Promotion gates tied to operating points and stability bands. Incident runbooks reference card limits and rollback SOPs. FAQ Are cards mandatory for all releases? Yes—cards and evidence make adoption predictable and audit-ready. Do cards expose IP? No. We publish metrics, limits, and manifests—not internal recipes. Can we customize for private listings? Yes—entitlements and private annexes are supported; core evidence remains consistent. Glossary Operating point : chosen threshold that maps to business capacity. Evidence bundle : signed metrics/configs/seeds/hashes. SBOM : software bill of materials for artifacts. Unity Catalog : governed registry for data/AI assets. Checklists Before release, confirm: Intent/limits stated for clarity. OP metrics + CIs linked for proof. Stability bands documented for reliability. Rollback SOP present for recovery. Packaging/paths verified for use. Support/refresh declared for service. All items are Intent/limits stated OP metrics + CIs linked Stability bands documented Rollback SOP present Packaging/paths verified Support/refresh declared Contact Sales → Appendix: Minimal HTML Card This simple card aids quick review. Use the minimal structure below: a short purpose, followed by an evidence list with concrete operating‑point utility and stability. Purpose Fraud triage at 1% FPR (analyst capacity aligned) Evidence Utility@OP: +0.18 lift (CI [0.161, 0.202]) Stability: max segment delta ≤ 0.028 Appendix: JSON Card Schema (Sketch) This schema standardizes cards. {name: \"string\", version: \"string\", intended_use: \"string\", limits: [\"string\"], operating_points: [{\"name\": \"string\", \"threshold\": 0.0}], evidence: {\"metrics\": [\"path\"], \"plots\": [\"path\"]}, packaging: {\"format\": \"mlflow|onnx|gguf\", \"uc_path\": \"catalog.schema.table\"}} defines structure. A developer building a card would use this { \"name\": \"string\", \"version\": \"string\", \"intended_use\": \"string\", \"limits\": [\"string\"], \"operating_points\": [{\"name\": \"string\", \"threshold\": 0.0}], \"evidence\": {\"metrics\": [\"path\"], \"plots\": [\"path\"]}, \"packaging\": {\"format\": \"mlflow|onnx|gguf\", \"uc_path\": \"catalog.schema.table\"} } Closing Cards that buyers actually use are boring in the best way —they answer the questions risk and engineering teams ask, with evidence and SOPs. That’s how you turn interest into adoption. All features are"}</script>
