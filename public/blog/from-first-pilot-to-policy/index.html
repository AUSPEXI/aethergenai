AethergenPlatform can transform these pilots into policy by implementing quality gates and delivering evidence bundles . These include operating point (OP) utility with confidence intervals, stability bands across segments, latency service level objectives (SLOs), and privacy probes—all signed and audit-ready—accelerating trust and deployment as of September 2025. Define the Gate: Setting Clear Standards Quality gates are the backbone of a successful pilot-to-policy journey. AethergenPlatform can help define these with your team: Operating Point (OP) : A threshold tied to analyst capacity (e.g., 100 cases/day) or safety budget (e.g., 1% FPR), ensuring practical relevance. Stability Bands : Consistency metrics across segments like region, product line, or lifecycle stage, with maximum allowable deltas (e.g., Latency Envelopes : p95 and p99 latency targets (e.g., 120ms and 180ms) to meet operational needs. Privacy Probe Thresholds : Limits on membership-inference or attribute-disclosure risks (e.g., Pilot SOP: A Structured Approach Turning a pilot into evidence requires a repeatable process. Here’s how AethergenPlatform can guide it: Freeze OP and Taxonomy : Collaborate with stakeholders to lock in the operating point and segment definitions (e.g., NA vs. EU regions). Run Evaluation : Execute tests, compute confidence intervals via bootstrapping, and generate interactive dashboards (HTML/PDF). Package Evidence Bundle : Assemble a signed ZIP with `metrics/`, `plots/`, `configs/`, `seeds/`, `sbom.json`, and `manifest.json`, including per-file hashes. Review and Rehearse : Present in change-control meetings, verify gates, and simulate rollback scenarios to ensure safety. Policy Promotion: Seamless Transition Moving to production requires robust integration. AethergenPlatform can support this transition: Fail-Closed Gates in CI : Continuous integration checks ensure OP utility, stability, latency, and privacy meet thresholds before promotion. Catalog Comments : Unity Catalog entries can reference evidence IDs (e.g., `bundle_id: 8e7...`) and OP thresholds for traceability. SLA Alignment : Service level agreements can tie to OP performance, stability bands, and refresh cadences (e.g., quarterly) for clear expectations. How Evidence Bundles Are Built AethergenPlatform automates evidence creation via CI, ensuring consistency: Schema and Data Prep : Define fields and generate synthetic or sampled data with logged seeds. Evaluation Pipeline : Run models, calculate metrics (utility, stability, latency), and perform privacy probes. Signing Process : Use `KeyManagementService` to sign `manifest.json` and the bundle, adding `signature.json` with public key fingerprints. Delivery : Upload to artifact storage, with PR comments linking to hashes for review.

<h1>From First Pilot to Policy: Building Trust with Quality Gates</h1>
  <p><em>By Gwylym Owen — 20–30 min read</em></p>

  <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>AI pilots often stall when results lack reproducibility or fail to satisfy rigorous reviews. AethergenPlatform can transform these pilots into policy by implementing <strong>quality gates</strong> and delivering <strong>evidence bundles</strong>. These include operating point (OP) utility with confidence intervals, stability bands across segments, latency service level objectives (SLOs), and privacy probes—all signed and audit-ready—accelerating trust and deployment as of September 2025.</p>

  <h2>Define the Gate: Setting Clear Standards</h2>
  <p>Quality gates are the backbone of a successful pilot-to-policy journey. AethergenPlatform can help define these with your team:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Operating Point (OP)</strong>: A threshold tied to analyst capacity (e.g., 100 cases/day) or safety budget (e.g., 1% FPR), ensuring practical relevance.</li>
    <li><strong>Stability Bands</strong>: Consistency metrics across segments like region, product line, or lifecycle stage, with maximum allowable deltas (e.g., < 3%).</li>
    <li><strong>Latency Envelopes</strong>: p95 and p99 latency targets (e.g., 120ms and 180ms) to meet operational needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Probe Thresholds</strong>: Limits on membership-inference or attribute-disclosure risks (e.g., < 5% advantage), with optional differential privacy (DP) budgets.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pilot SOP: A Structured Approach</h2>
  <p>Turning a pilot into evidence requires a repeatable process. Here’s how AethergenPlatform can guide it:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Freeze OP and Taxonomy</strong>: Collaborate with stakeholders to lock in the operating point and segment definitions (e.g., NA vs. EU regions).</li>
    <li><strong>Run Evaluation</strong>: Execute tests, compute confidence intervals via bootstrapping, and generate interactive dashboards (HTML/PDF).</li>
    <li><strong>Package Evidence Bundle</strong>: Assemble a signed ZIP with `metrics/`, `plots/`, `configs/`, `seeds/`, `sbom.json`, and `manifest.json`, including per-file hashes.</li>
    <li><strong>Review and Rehearse</strong>: Present in change-control meetings, verify gates, and simulate rollback scenarios to ensure safety.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Policy Promotion: Seamless Transition</h2>
  <p>Moving to production requires robust integration. AethergenPlatform can support this transition:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fail-Closed Gates in CI</strong>: Continuous integration checks ensure OP utility, stability, latency, and privacy meet thresholds before promotion.</li>
    <li><strong>Catalog Comments</strong>: Unity Catalog entries can reference evidence IDs (e.g., `bundle_id: 8e7...`) and OP thresholds for traceability.</li>
    <li><strong>SLA Alignment</strong>: Service level agreements can tie to OP performance, stability bands, and refresh cadences (e.g., quarterly) for clear expectations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Evidence Bundles Are Built</h2>
  <p>AethergenPlatform automates evidence creation via CI, ensuring consistency:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Schema and Data Prep</strong>: Define fields and generate synthetic or sampled data with logged seeds.</li>
