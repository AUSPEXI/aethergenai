In production AI, focus on the operating point, data contracts, selective prediction, and energy‑aware deployment. The result is better reliability at lower cost. Why Pareto Matters for AI Teams often chase marginal model accuracy while the biggest wins sit elsewhere: choosing the right operating point, setting clear contracts, and routing uncertain cases. Pareto thinking turns these into first‑class levers. Four 80/20 Levers Operating Point (OP) : pick the threshold that maximises expected utility for your risk class and latency budget, not just global accuracy. Selective Prediction : allow abstain when support is thin; measure coverage and wrong‑answer rate at the same time budget. Data Contracts : lock in schema, units, and ranges; test violations early. Quality jumps when upstream is governed. Energy‑Aware Profiles : choose the lowest‑power quantisation/runtime that meets your OP. Cost and carbon fall together. Few levers → most gains Operating point Selective prediction Data contracts Energy profile Measuring What Matters Fixed‑coverage evaluation : hold latency and acceptance rate constant; compare wrong‑answer rate and re‑ask rate before/after controls. Segment stability : watch variation across regions/products/time windows; tune OPs where gaps persist. Energy KPI : tokens/sec or tasks/joule at OP; track quantisation swaps vs quality. From “Noise” to Value (IP‑safe overview) Most systems discard the by‑products of inference—uncertain spans, disagreement between sources, failed tool calls, and mundane telemetry. We treat these signals as a resource (without storing raw content): Lightweight summaries : compress uncertainty and outcome signals into simple counts/percentiles by group and time window (no raw text or images). These summaries help pick safer operating points. Verify‑or‑abstain routing : when evidence is thin, prefer a helpful abstention or a quick clarification over a confident error. Coverage stays tunable, and risk is explicit. Group‑aware tuning : where allowed, use the summaries to set per‑group thresholds so quality and stability improve in the places that need it most. Targeted robustness : hard examples are synthesised from the edges of the distribution (again, from summaries—not raw data) to retrain small improvements where they count. Energy‑aware profiles : pick the lowest‑power quantisation/runtime that keeps the same quality at the chosen acceptance level. This approach stays privacy‑first and publication‑safe: we work with aggregate signals and ship the results as evidence (thresholds chosen, metrics achieved), not the implementation internals. How We Operate We prioritise runtime reliability and auditability: gate answers when support is weak, verify outputs against contracts, and deliver signed evidence with configuration and metrics. When energy is the constraint, we choose the lightest profile that passes the same gates.

    <h2>Why Pareto Matters for AI</h2>

      <li><strong>Data Contracts</strong>: lock in schema, units, and ranges; test violations early. Quality jumps when upstream is governed.</li>
