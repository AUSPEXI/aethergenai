# Founders Story Images

This directory should contain the following images for the founder's story:

1. **fall.jpg** - Image representing "The Fall" chapter (25 years, then everything changed)
2. **cairo.jpg** - Image representing "The Recovery" chapter (3 years in Cairo, finding myself)
3. **crypto.jpg** - Image representing "The Descent" chapter (love, crypto, and everything lost)
4. **gardening.jpg** - Image representing "The Grind" chapter (10 hours gardening + 120 hours building)
5. **success.jpg** - Image representing "The Rise" chapter (1 billion records, global leadership)

## Image Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG/JPEG
- **Aspect Ratio**: 1:1 (square) recommended
- **Resolution**: Minimum 800x800px, preferably 1200x1200px or higher
- **Content**: Professional, authentic photos that represent each chapter of the founder's journey

## Current Status:
- Images need to be added by the user
- Component is ready to display images once they are placed in this directory
- Fallback styling will show until images are added

## Notes:
- The gardening image should show the authentic, grounded nature of the founder's work
- Images should reflect the professional yet personal nature of the story
- Avoid overly polished stock photos - authenticity is key
